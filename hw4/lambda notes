iterate through indicators and set them equal to 1 if that prototype is in fact the closest one to that instance and the min_dist < lambda

for (i = 0; i < indicators.length; i++):
	if 


confirmed works:
- finding initial mean of all instances





NAIVE BAYES

confirmed works:
- initializing mean and variance
- ln_gaussian probability

pretty sure works:
- initializing phi works
- initializing S works
